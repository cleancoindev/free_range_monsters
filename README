Free Range Monsters is a roguelike where you create a monster and guide its evolution while trying to stay alive.

Current State
-------------
Early alpha, not really playable yet, more of a framework for creating a create your own monster game.

Installation
------------

To run it from source, you'll need to install LÃ–VE:

    http://love2d.org/

Then run the app.  

In OS X, I run it in development from the terminal:

    alias love="/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love"
    love .

Windows and Linux run instructions: http://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started

To do list
----------
* Player should level up 4 times when creating a new monster.  Tutorial levels are always boring.  Lets just jump into the action.
* Make multiple sectors (maps) and a transport mechanism for moving the player from one sector to another when they walk off the screen
* Make monster part attributes actually impact combat
* Make monster parts for vision and have that actually impact the range of perception
* Make the map use the bold vera font rather than the normal one, too hard to read
* Add lots and lots more monster parts, like 100+ more
* Add lots and lots more crypts
* Figure out what to do with hunger
* Make the crypt addition code occasionally flip the crypt vertically and horizontally

Long term
---------
* Send the monster to the server on level up, and download other player's monsters
* Add an ability screen for triggering special abilities (e.g., burrow, spit acid, chameleon skin, fly, etc.)
* Biomes

Things considered
-----------------
* Make leveling up a more dramatic affair, lay an egg and protect it from a wave of monsters, when it hatches you level up and continue playing as the new creature
* Somehow unlock rare monster parts by defeating those monsters for the first time?
